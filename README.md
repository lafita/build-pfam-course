# Build your own protein family

This is a tutorial-style project ran during the **EIPP Bioinformatics Course** at the **EMBL-EBI**, part of the **EMBL Predoc Course** training programme for PhD students. It was first run in November 2018 and again in November 2019 for two different Predoc batches.

This repository contains some of the materials for the course and the results for the example protein.
Tutorial handouts can be found at https://goo.gl/NQBuWm (2018) and https://tinyurl.com/eipp2019 (2019).

Hope you find it useful!
